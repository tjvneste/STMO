    "This notebook will cover two straightforward algorithms for approximately minimizing one-dimensional functions: *grid search* and *random search*. Both are used extensively in, for example, machine learning to find optimal hyperparameters. These two algorithms are ideal to get acquainted with the basics of Julia!\n",

    "# Grid search\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize a one-dimensional function $f(x)$ using grid search in the interval $[a, b]$, we search the interval over $n$ equally-spaced steps and take value that results in the lowest objective value. The larger $n$, the more function evaluations and the better quality the solution will be. Even though grid search being ubiquitously used in machine learning, it is a biased method and often does not yield as good results as the random search. In some cases, it makes sense to search on a logarithmic scale as opposed to a linear scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search can easily be extended to higher dimensions by extending the grid $a_i\\le x_i \\le b_j$, hence providing upper and lower bounds for every dimension. This approach is also called a *full factorial sampling*. Due to the curse of dimensionality, one has to perform exponentially more function evaluations to cover the search space. \n",

    "# Random search\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize a one-dimensional function $f(x)$ using random search, we generate $n$ random values of $x$ in the interval $[a, b]$ and take the one with the lowest objective value. Clever algorithms use other samplings than uniform, driving the search towards particular regions of the search space. Random search can easily be extended to higher dimensions.\n",
